## 🚀 Key Findings & Recommendations

### 1. Optimizing Routing & Dispatching
| Action | Insight‑Driven Benefit |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| **Dynamic dispatching** | Deploy more taxis to high‑demand zones during peak hours; tailor strategies for day vs. night. |
| **Route optimization** | Bypass chronically congested corridors to cut delays. |
| **Idle‑time reduction** | Align drop‑off and next pick‑up zones to minimize empty miles. |
| **Real‑time integration** | Feed live traffic, weather, and driver feedback into dispatch logic. |
| **Visual hotspot mapping** | Quickly spot airport surges and entertainment‑district peaks. |

### 2. Strategic Cab Positioning Across Time & Space
* Concentrate cabs in **business districts (AM)** and **night‑life zones (PM)**.  
* Shift supply between **residential → commercial → entertainment** areas as the day progresses.  
* Adapt weekend vs. weekday deployments; account for big events and tourist seasons.  
* Use nearby, less‑congested zones as staging areas to prevent oversupply bottlenecks.  
* Continuously refine positioning with **live demand heat‑maps**.

### 3. Data‑Driven Pricing Strategy
* **Tiered fares** for short / medium / long trips.  
* **Dynamic (surge) pricing** during peak demand; discounts off‑peak.  
* **Group incentives** to boost shared rides and load factors.  
* Optimize the **base fare–tips balance** to maintain driver earnings and customer satisfaction.  
* Track competitor pricing to stay attractive in fare‑sensitive zones.  
* Apply surcharges (congestion, airport) **transparently**.  
* Establish a feedback loop to adjust rates based on revenue & rider sentiment.
